# CLAUDE.md — hano.studios

Context for Claude Code working in this repo.

## What this is

Marketing site for Hano Studios, a creative agency working in Web3 / trading / fintech.
Static site: plain HTML, CSS and JS. **No build step, no package.json, no framework.**
Open `index.html` directly, or serve with `python3 -m http.server`.

Do not introduce a bundler, framework or dependency manager unless explicitly asked.

## Brand tokens — do not invent new colours

From the official brand guidelines. Defined in `:root`.

| Token | Hex | Name |
|---|---|---|
| `--void` | `#0A0A0A` | Void Black |
| `--frost` | `#FFFFFF` | Frost White |
| `--nebula` | `#47127C` | Royal Nebula |
| `--aurora` | `#8B32F7` | Aurora Purple |

Type: **Instrument Sans** display + body (letter-spacing -2% to -4.5% on large sizes),
**Aleo** italic used exactly once, on "dominate markets" in the hero. The guidelines call
for restraint on the serif — keep it that way.

Heading pattern throughout is two-tone: `<h2 class="h-split"><strong>Bold lead</strong> light remainder</h2>`.

## Page sections in order

hero (pinned: title rises to centre, divides, square grows to cover) → statement
(pinned: lines reveal one per scroll, then floats and sticks) + clients → works
(horizontal pin ≥701px, plain vertical stack below — gsap.matchMedia tears the
tween down and CSS lays out the stack) → showcase carousel (video, auto-advance) →
circle wipe → services (light) → team (grows out of the white on scroll) → FAQ →
CTA → footer (Aurora purple, frame 173; the deep Nebula stays on the menu overlay)

There is no separate split section any more. The hero title itself is the element
that divides — `.ht-a` / `.ht-b` are the two words and `.hero-square` is the
transition square. Removing the hero pin means rebuilding that sequence.
The hero pin uses `pinSpacing:false` (the square covers the screen at the end, so
reserved spacing was only ever a black void) and the statement pin box is sized by
padding, not 100svh — both were the causes of the recurring "huge gap" reports.

Footer copyright reads "© 2026 Hano **Animations**" (frame 173 — the legal
entity); the wordmark and the menu overlay say Hano **Studios** (frame 183).
This is deliberate, not a typo.

## Every image in assets/img/ is a placeholder

Generated gradients at final dimensions with final filenames. **To swap in real work,
overwrite the file at the same path. No code changes needed.**

| Path | Count | Dimensions |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/img/works/` | 5 | 4 real posters (`.jpg`) + 1 placeholder (`.svg`) — see below |
| `assets/img/showcase/` | 5 | posters, real frames of the clips |
| `assets/img/services/` | 6 | 800×800 (1:1) — currently unreferenced, see below |
| `assets/img/team/` | 2 | 800×1000 (4:5) — **real photos, not placeholder** |
| `assets/img/og-image.jpg` | 1 | 1200×630 |

**Four of the five work cards play their mockup clip, not a still.** Bybit,
Kalshi, Hano Crypto and Maxy each hold a `<video class="work-video" data-src="...">`
inside `.work-img`, on both `index.html` and `work/index.html`. Encoded from
`Bybit mockup.mp4`, `Kalshi Mochup Video.mp4`, `Hano Crypto Mock Up.mp4` and
`Maxy Render Video.mp4` in the repo root (gitignored) — all genuinely 16:9, no
rotation trap on any of them — at the usual CRF 27 / long edge 960, but `-an`:
they are ambient card visuals and carry no audio. Only Levels Socials keeps its
placeholder `.svg`, because no clip was supplied for it.

Maxy's card has no `<a class="work-link">` wrapper — its case study does not
exist yet — so the `<video>` nests straight inside `.work-img`. The controller
selects on `.work-video[data-src]`, not on the link, so this works unchanged;
don't add a wrapper to "match" the others until the page is built.

The still stays as the `.work-img` background and is never replaced: it is the
poster, painted before a byte of video is fetched and left in place if the clip
fails, if the visitor has reduced motion, or if the card is never reached. The
clip fades in only on the `playing` event, so a stalled video never shows a
black rectangle. `assets/img/works/{bybit,kalshi,hano-crypto,maxy}.jpg` are frames
grabbed from those clips at `-ss 1`; the `.svg` versions they replaced are gone.

The controller lives in main.js **outside the GSAP block** — these have to work
under `.no-gsap`, where the Works strip degrades to a plain `overflow-x:auto`
container. Testing that path means scrolling the section into view vertically
*first* and then panning the container sideways; panning while it is still
off-screen gives the IntersectionObserver nothing to fire on and looks like a
bug in working code. On the landing page proper, `scrollIntoView` on a card is
also the wrong move: the strip is pinned and travels horizontally with *page*
scroll, so a card's own scroll position never brings it into view.

**`assets/img/team/` is real, not placeholder.** Built from the HD originals in
`Team Photos/` (`JohannesHD.JPG`, `HannahHD.JPG`). Both needed cropping to 4:5
before resizing, and Johannes's especially: his original is *landscape* 1280x961
with him small and off-centre right, which is what "zoomed out" meant. It is
cropped to 769x961 around him, then resized. Hannah's is 960x1280 portrait and
only loses 80px off the bottom. Re-cropping means redoing that framing by hand —
a plain resize of the landscape original will reintroduce the problem.

**`assets/img/clients/` is real, not placeholder.** Every mark is the client's own
artwork, and the same files are reused as the works-card titles (`.work-logo`),
with a visually-hidden `<h3>` kept beside each so the cards still have headings. The eight PNGs are built from `Client Logos/` (repo root) by
`tools/make-client-logos.py` — re-run that after changing anything in there, don't
hand-edit the output. They are tightly cropped, *not* padded to a fixed canvas: the set
mixes wide wordmarks with square roundels, and the CSS caps both width and height so the
two kinds land at the same optical weight.

**Bybit and Maxy are `.svg` and are NOT rebuilt by the tool.** Both needed a fill edited
for a dark ground — Bybit's wordmark was `#15182A`, and Maxy's paths declared no `fill`
at all, which SVG renders as black. Maxy is filled `#F26B21` (client orange, set on its
`.cls-1` class). Editing either source means redoing that by hand.

The grid sits on Void Black, so polarity matters more than format. Adding a logo means
checking it against black, not assuming — the supplied set alone included pure-black
artwork (Algorand), a light mark inside a dark badge on a white page (Abstract), and a
wordmark on a near-black square (Levels Socials). The tool's modes are `keep` /
`whiten` / `dropbg`; its docstring explains which to reach for and why a luminance key
is the wrong tool for the Abstract case.

`Client Logos/` also holds a dozen further real client marks not currently on the site,
plus `Pudgy Penguins Wordmark.png` — an alternative to the roundel that is **not** used,
because its "PENGUINS" half is dark navy and disappears against Void Black.

## Case study pages (`work/`)

`work/bybit.html` (181), `work/kalshi.html` (207) and `work/hano-crypto.html`
(208) are built — copy any of them for Maxy and Levels Socials. **The Crypteum
case study was built (frame 209) and then deleted on request**, along with its
card, artwork, clips and every reference; don't resurrect it from git without
asking. They reuse `css/styles.css` and `js/main.js` wholesale; only the
CASE STUDY block in the CSS and the "Case-study galleries" block in main.js are
specific to them. Everything outside the `<article class="case">` is
byte-identical across all three, so keep it that way when adding a page.


Kalshi differs from Bybit in three ways the frame dictates: no `<h1>` (the lead
paragraph sits alone beside the logo), a single 9:16 clip on `.slide-tall`
rather than a multi-slide strip, and a `.case-ig` "View on Instagram" caption.

Hano Crypto is the longest frame and adds two more: `.case-post` +
`.case-metrics` for a viral-post title with its engagement line above its own
clip, and `.slide-board` for the wide 1340x712 mood board. **`.slide-board`
needs `.slide.slide-board` specificity** — as a single class it loses to the
later `.slide img{width:auto;height:100%}` and the slide collapses to 0 high.
It also has no "Why It Matters" section; don't add one.

Hano Crypto's mark is the client's own artwork at
`assets/img/clients/hano-crypto.png`, built from `Logowhite.PNG` in the repo
root — a purple roundel with black type. Two earlier attempts (a raster crop off
the mood board, then a hand-built vector) were both wrong and are gone. It is
circular, so it carries `.case-logo-round` on the case study and a taller
`.work-logo` cap on the cards: at the wordmark height a circle reads as a stray
dot next to Bybit's or Levels Socials' wide marks.
Paths are `../` throughout, and the menu's Work/Process/Team/FAQ links point at
`../index.html#…` so they work from a subdirectory.

**Frame 181 indents the whole document; it is not a two-column grid.** The left
column is a margin holding only the client logo and the "Why It Matters" label —
section headings sit in the copy column, above their own paragraphs, *not* out
in the margin. Only those two rows are grids (`.case-row`); every ordinary
section is a `.case-sec` block pushed across by `--indent`. That variable has to
reproduce the grid's own maths: `.26fr` against `1fr` is **not** 26%, it is
`.26/1.26` of the width less the gap. Treating it as 26% puts every heading 70px
right of the galleries.

**`.case-brand` is absolutely positioned inside the header `.case-row`, and that
is load-bearing.** A grid row is as tall as its tallest cell, and in the header
that is usually the client mark — so `margin-bottom` was being measured from the
bottom of the *logo* rather than from the last line of copy, and the gap above
"Overview" tracked logo height instead of being consistent: 134px on Hano Crypto
(116px round badge beside one line of lead), 67px on Kalshi, 52px on Bybit.
`align-items:start` does **not** fix this — it changes how items stretch within
a row, not the row's height. Taking the column out of flow removes it from the
height calculation while it still paints in the left margin, and the grid still
reserves the track, so `--indent` is untouched. Two consequences to keep:
`.case-row > .case-brand + *{ grid-column:2 }`, because an out-of-flow child is
also out of auto-placement and the copy would otherwise land in column 1 at the
narrow logo track's width; and both rules are reverted at `max-width:760px`,
where the layout is single-column and an absolute brand would sit on top of the
intro text. Verified at 1470/1200/900/761/760/600/390 on all three pages: a
uniform gap, no overlap, heading left edge == copy left edge.

Galleries are `[data-gallery]`; main.js wires arrows, dots, swipe and per-slide
video play/pause for any number of them per page. **Slides are capped on both
axes** — a height cap alone makes 16:9 stills ~1.8x the phone's width, a width
cap alone lets the track grow to the tallest slide and strands the arrows
hundreds of px below a short one. `align-items:flex-start` stops flex equalising
their heights.

Videos use `preload="none"`, so nothing downloads for slides never reached — but
that also leaves the element at `readyState 0` with no source selected, and
`play()` on that rejects without ever fetching. main.js calls `load()` first the
one time a slide becomes active. **Playwright's bundled Chromium has no
proprietary codecs** (`canPlayType('video/mp4; codecs="avc1…"')` is empty), so
playback can only be verified with `chromium.launch({channel:'chrome'})` — it
fails there for the existing showcase clips too, which is the browser, not the file.

Source masters live outside the repo: `~/Downloads/bybit` (88MB),
`~/Downloads/Kalshi` (88MB), `~/Downloads/Hano Crypto` (397MB) and
`~/Downloads/Crypteum` (42MB). Re-encoded to 5.4MB, 2.4MB, 7.2MB and 3.8MB with
the same settings the showcase clips use: H.264, CRF 27, long edge 960, AAC 96k,
`+faststart`. Kalshi's poster is grabbed at `-ss 3` — the clip opens on
near-black, so frame 0 gives a 4.5KB blank; Hano Crypto ships its own posters.

**ffprobe reports Crypteum's master as 1920x1080 but it is a 9:16 reel** — that
is the stored size, read before the rotation metadata. `scale=-2:960` handles it
and the output is a correct 540x960; don't "fix" the orientation by hand.

## Two deliberate resilience behaviours — don't remove them

1. `main.js` adds `.js` to `<html>` on execution. `.reveal` elements are only hidden via
   `.js .reveal`. If `main.js` fails to load, all content stays visible instead of being
   stranded at `opacity:0`.
2. An inline script in `<head>` adds `.no-gsap` when GSAP is unavailable (blocked CDN, ad
   blocker, CSP). CSS then degrades the pinned Works section, the split transition and the
   circle wipe to plain scrollable layout. Without this, the Works section becomes
   completely unreachable for those users.

Both were verified by killing the scripts. Keep them if you refactor.

## Known outstanding work

- **No testimonials section.** It was removed because the quotes were invented. Figma
  lists REVIEWS in both the menu overlay and the footer, so both links are currently
  left out — restore the section and both links together once there are real,
  client-approved quotes.
- **The showcase clips are real.** Five, in this order: Trump's Planned Crash,
  Bybit, Direct Signals, War Against Iran, Algorand RWA. Two are copies of case
  study clips (`work/hano-crypto/trumps-planned-crash.mp4` and
  `war-against-china.mp4` — the same file; the reel covers Iran later on, which
  is why the showcase copy is named `war-against-iran.mp4`). The other three are
  re-encoded from `Showcase Videos (source)/`, which is gitignored. Posters are
  grabbed at `-ss 3`.
- ~~**Showcase videos are not supplied yet.**~~ Each `.phone` holds a `<video>` with the
  existing still as its `poster`. The playback controller in `main.js` is finished and
  verified: it plays the active slide, auto-advances on `ended`, wraps around, pauses
  off-screen, and the arrows work. It activates per phone the moment you add
  `data-src="assets/video/showcase/<slug>.mp4"` to that `<video>` — there is a comment
  beside each one with the exact line. A phone with no `data-src` just shows its poster,
  so no missing file is ever requested.
- **Calendly is live**: `https://calendly.com/hanostudios/discovery` — the event
  itself, so the widget opens straight on the calendar rather than on an event
  list. The older `/hanoanimations/discovery` URL now 404s, which is what made
  the modal show Calendly's own error page. The URL appears twice per page —
  `#calEmbed`'s `data-url` and the `<noscript>` link beside it — across all five
  pages, plus `llms.txt` and the `contactPoint` in the homepage schema; change
  them together.
  **Do not paste Calendly's own UI params** (`?back=1&month=YYYY-MM`) from the
  address bar: `month=` pins the widget to that month forever, so a visitor
  months later still lands on it. `cal_full.js` asserts `month=` is absent.
  **The dark theme does not apply.** The colour params are on `data-url` *and*
  passed as `pageSettings` in main.js, and Calendly puts them on the iframe URL,
  but the widget still renders white — colour customisation is a paid feature.
  Don't spend time re-plumbing it; it needs a plan upgrade, not code.
- **Instagram, X and LinkedIn are real** — `hano.studios`, `HanoStudioss` and
  `linkedin.com/company/hano-studios/`, in both the footer and the menu overlay
  on all five pages (15 links). LinkedIn is also in the homepage schema's
  `sameAs`. **Tik Tok was removed on request** — there is no Tik Tok link
  anywhere now, so don't reintroduce one without a supplied handle. The FAQ copy
  still names TikTok as a platform we deliver *for*; that is prose, not a link.
- **"Process" was removed from the nav on request.** The showcase section keeps
  `id="process"` so any link already shared as `/#process` still resolves, but
  nothing in the site points at it. Two comments in main.js explain a resync that
  a deep link to that anchor can still trigger — the behaviour is still needed.
- The services list no longer shows a hover preview (removed on request). The
  `<li>`s keep their `data-tone` / `data-img`, so restoring it means the markup
  plus a handler in main.js — the 6 images in `assets/img/services/` are
  currently unreferenced but kept for that, and their filenames track the
  labels.
- **The services list is the six the client named**: Motion Design, Branding, Web
  Design, Social Media Marketing, UX/UI, Ad Funnels. This replaced an earlier
  seven that included Graphic Design, Website Design, Launch Leading, Full
  Marketing and Ad Campaigns. The `makesOffer` block in the homepage schema
  mirrors it — change both together.
- Plausible is wired in `<head>` with `data-domain="hanostudios.xyz"`. It only starts
  recording once the site is added in the Plausible dashboard. Cookieless, so no
  consent banner. A `Booking opened` goal fires from `main.js` when the Calendly
  modal opens — add it as a goal in Plausible to see conversions.

## Tracking (Meta Pixel + Conversions API)

`js/consent.js` owns all of it. Nothing tracking-related belongs in a `<script>`
tag in the HTML — it would run before consent.

Three events, in funnel order: **PageView** (on pixel load), **Contact** (click of
any `[data-calendly]` trigger), **Lead** (Calendly posts `calendly.event_scheduled`
from its inline iframe). Pixel ID `1282102860523144`.

**Every event goes out twice**, browser (`fbq`) and server (`POST /api/capi` →
Meta Conversions API), carrying the **same `event_id`** so Meta deduplicates them.
The server leg is a first-party request, so it survives the content blockers and
iOS privacy that eat `connect.facebook.net` — which is the whole reason it is
there. Changing one leg without the other breaks deduplication and doubles every
number in the ad account.

`api/` is two plain Node functions with no dependencies. Vercel picks them up
automatically; this does **not** introduce a build step or a package.json, and
`_meta.js` is not routed because Vercel ignores `_`-prefixed files.

Set in **Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables** (nothing secret in the repo):

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `META_PIXEL_ID` | `1282102860523144` |
| `META_CAPI_TOKEN` | Events Manager → Settings → Conversions API → Generate access token |
| `META_TEST_EVENT_CODE` | optional; routes events to Test Events. **Remove after verifying** or nothing counts as live. |

Without the token `/api/capi` returns 501 and the browser leg carries on alone,
so a missing variable degrades rather than breaks.

**`?fbdebug=1` on any URL** turns on console logging for the rest of the session —
every event sent, every Calendly message received, and the *reason* an event was
skipped. Reach for it before touching code: "Meta shows nothing" is far more often
refused consent or a blocker than a bug. Verified end-to-end in a real browser:
the listener fires `Lead` exactly once from a genuine `https://calendly.com`
origin, ignores repeats, and ignores same-origin spoofs.

The Lead `event_id` is derived from Calendly's own invitee URI (`lead_<uuid>`),
not from a random value, so a server-side Calendly webhook could later report the
same booking and still deduplicate. That webhook is **not** built — it is the only
way to get a hashed email into the server event, so it is the next step if match
quality needs to improve.

Marketing consent gates both legs. Server-side is the same processing over a
different pipe, not a way around the GDPR.

## SEO / AEO

**Canonical host is `https://www.hanostudios.xyz`** — the apex 301s to it, so every
canonical, sitemap `<loc>`, `og:url` and schema `@id` must use `www`. Mixing the two
splits the ranking signal.

`robots.txt` allows the AI answer engines by name (GPTBot, OAI-SearchBot,
PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, Google-Extended, Applebot-Extended and others) — several
read robots.txt for their own token and ignore rules inherited from `*`. Serving them
is deliberate: the case studies with real numbers are exactly what we want quoted.

`sitemap.xml` lists all five pages; regenerate `lastmod` from git when adding one.

Structured data is one `application/ld+json` block per page:
- `index.html` — `Organization`/`ProfessionalService` (+ `knowsAbout`, `makesOffer`,
  `sameAs`), `WebSite`, and `FAQPage` built from the real `<details>` copy.
- each `work/*.html` — `CreativeWork` naming the client and its metrics, plus
  `BreadcrumbList`, both referencing the org by `@id`.

**Every number in the schema also appears in the visible copy.** Schema that claims
more than the page says is a manual-action risk, not a shortcut — if you change a
metric, change both.

Frames 207/208 draw no headline, so those pages carry a visually-hidden
`<h1 class="sr-only">`. `.sr-only` clips rather than `display:none`, which would drop
it from the accessibility tree as well as from search.

Titles are kept under ~70 characters and descriptions ~150–170, or they get
truncated in results.

**`services/` is generated — never hand-edit those six files.** They exist
because the landing page is a portfolio and a portfolio cannot answer "what does
a Web3 motion design agency do". `tools/make-service-pages.py` lifts the head and
tail verbatim from `work/kalshi.html`, so the menu, Calendly modal, CTA and
footer stay identical across all eight content pages; re-run it after touching
that shell. Each page carries `Service` + `FAQPage` + `BreadcrumbList` schema, and links to
all four case studies plus its five siblings — adding a service to `SERVICES` in
the tool propagates the cross-links automatically.

**Scope boundary, stated on the website-development page and in `llms.txt`: we
design and build front-end sites, we do NOT write or audit smart contracts.**
That was the user's answer when asked directly; don't add blockchain-engineering
claims without checking again.

The tool substitutes its JSON-LD with a lambda rather than a replacement string —
`re.sub` interprets backslashes in a string replacement, and JSON containing a
`\u` escape raises `bad escape \u`.

`llms.txt` (llmstxt.org) is the plain-text brief for AI answer engines: what the
agency does, the verified numbers, and links to every page. Update it whenever a
headline metric changes — it is the file most likely to be quoted verbatim.

**The site is exactly the five pages the product designer drew — do not add
more.** Six SEO service pages and a "More work" cross-link strip were built and
then removed on request: the design is owned by the product designer and pages
that are not in Figma do not ship, regardless of their SEO value. Any future SEO
work has to fit inside the existing five pages, or happen off-site (directories,
backlinks, social). This is a standing constraint, not a one-off.

A consequence worth knowing: the four case studies are deliberate dead ends with
no links between them, so they pass no authority to one another.

Hano Crypto's follower count is **148,000** as of 29 Jul 2026 and appears in copy,
meta and schema on several pages. The Kalshi case study deliberately still says
135,000+ — that describes the audience size *at the time of that partnership*, so
don't "fix" it to today's number.

## Conventions

- `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected; preserve it in anything new.
- Keep focus-visible outlines (`--aurora`).
- Responsive breakpoints at 900px and 600px.
- CSS is organised in commented blocks in section order. Add to the matching block rather
  than appending to the end of the file.
